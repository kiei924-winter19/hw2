# Homework Assignment #2
## KIEI-924 Fall 2018

### Guidelines for submission

From your Cloud9 IDE, grab this repository:

```
cd ~/environment
git clone https://github.com/kiei924-fall18/hw2
cd hw2
./cleanup
```

This will create a directory called `hw2` in your Cloud9 IDE.

Complete the homework per the instructions in the `hw2.rb` file.

Right-click on the `hw2` folder in the sidebar in Cloud9. Select "Download", which will create a file named `hw2.tar.gz`. Upload this file into Canvas as your submission.
